# Cloud Playground
Hi and welcome to my site ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal GitHub account for discovering, playing with, learning, testing and sometimes breaking things.
About me: I'm a seasoned Cloud Engineer based in Melbourne, Australia, working with Azure Cloud, IaC (terraform, bicep) and serverless, composable architecture.
